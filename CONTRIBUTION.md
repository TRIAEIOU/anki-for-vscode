## Extensions used:

- ESlint
- EditorConfig
- Prettier

These just ensure the code is consistent, you should be able to have format on save enabled which should make it much easier to handle formatting.

## Debugging

First open up Anki. Then go to the "Debug" tab and click "Run Extension".
This should allow you to try sending notes into Anki whilst stepping through the code and setting breakpoints.
